AI assistance in this project was used in a limited and targeted manner.

The backend code was shared with AI specifically for optimization purposes,
including query structure and data processing improvements.

A responsive CSS version was generated based on the existing styles in order
to adapt the layout for different devices, such as mobile phones and tablets.

Database files (`schema.sql` and `seed.sql`) were generated using ChatGPT based
on an existing database dump, in order to separate schema definition and seed
data for easier setup and deployment.

All core logic, architectural decisions, UI implementation, and final code
were developed and applied independently.
